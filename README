krdwrd - the KrdWrd App:
our back-end application that processes user annotations and extracts features from Web pages for further automatic processing.

Requirements: 
bash, subversion, awk, Xvfb, xulrunner


* get the current app:
$ svn co https://krdwrd.org/svn/trunk/src/app
>[...]
>Checked out external at revision ...


* change into the app's directory
$ cd krdwrd_app/


* copy our config file into your personal copy that will be used:
$ cp config.dist config.app


* have a look into the file
* make sure you have a supprted xulrunner (cf. https://krdwrd.org/trac/browser/trunk/external/XULRunner) and
  and the config points to it


* try-out the app:
$ PATH_TO_YOUR/xulrunner application.ini -pipe https://krdwrd.org/pages/dat/canola/merged/684 -out /tmp/kwfoo

> you should see a window popping up, a page loading, and you should end up with files:
/tmp/kwfoo.cl
/tmp/kwfoo.dom
/tmp/kwfoo.gold
/tmp/kwfoo.png
/tmp/kwfoo.txt
/tmp/kwfoo.xy


* get an impression of the output and try:
$ paste -d'\t' /tmp/kwfoo.gold  /tmp/kwfoo.txt

> this will give you a side-by-side view of the assigned tags and the text-nodes (where text that is spread over more than one text node - e.g. because it is interrupted by a link - will be repeated over so many lines as nodes are covered...)


* take your favourite image viewer and have a look at /tmp/kwfoo.png


* try the 'screen-less' version of the app, i.e. the wrapper that uses Xvfb to execute the xulrunner in the background for batch processing
$ ./krdwrd -pipe https://krdwrd.org/pages/dat/canola/merged/684 -out /tmp/kwbar

> you should now have files /tmp/kwbar.{cl,...,png,...} - just as the former ones


congrats, you are ready to use the app now!

...and have a look at: 
$ grabf.sh -h
$ harvest.sh -h
